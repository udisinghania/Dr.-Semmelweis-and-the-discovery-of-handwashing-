# Semmelweis and the Discovery of Handwashing

This project analyzes 19th-century medical records from Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis, showing how handwashing dramatically reduced maternal mortality. We use Python and pandas to explore the data and visualize the change before and after handwashing protocols.

## Tools Used
- Python
- pandas, matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## Key Insight
Handwashing reduced mortality by over 10%, showing the power of data-informed decision making.

## How to Run
Open `semmelweis-analysis.ipynb` in a Jupyter environment and run all cells.
